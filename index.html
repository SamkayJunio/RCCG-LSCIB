                <p>We want to take a moment to extend a very warm welcome to everyone on this glorious day. Whether you're just having a look, or are searching out for a place to worship, we're delighted to have you here.

                </p>
                <p>
                So firstly, we're all about Jesus Christ. We believe that Jesus was who he said he was, the Son of God who came and died for our sins. So if this is your first time in church, we hope that get to know Him as we do, because He's truly what life is all about for us!
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Secondly we're all about people. Every person who walks through our doors is important to us, so if you ever feel like just another number, we're doing something wrong and I give you permission to tell me about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                As a group of God's people we care about you and your family and we're here not only to feed you spiritually, but to help in any way we can. We love doing it and it's why we exist!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thirdly, we're all about relationships. We hope to cultivate and grow meaningful and positive relationships between another, but also go further by getting and growing in relationship with God. Christianity is all about a Person, and less about a set of rules. That means that we exist to be in a relationship with Someone, that's Jesus, and merely not to obey a religion.
                </p>    
                <p>That's us in a nutshell!</p>
            
                <p>Enjoy the rest of your worship time with us, and God bless you! </p>
